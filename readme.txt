The plugin will allow the visitor to see total post count.

== Description ==

This plugin counts and displays all hits/views in each post on your blog and saves it to the database. 
Views are counted each time a page or post is requested/refreshed (unique and non-unique visitors) and displayed in the posts entry meta.
This plugin works on all posts and pages - no administrations necessary - easy installation.

== Installation ==

1. Download the file
2. Upload and extract the contents of this file to your wp-content/plugins/folder
3. Activate the Simple Post Views Counter in your WP-admin
4. Add this code exactly as you see it to your themes single.php file:  `<br />This post has been viewed <?php echo_views(get_the_ID()); ?> times`
5. Please refer to the included images to see where exactly you need to paste the code.
6. Done! Your posts will now have the total views included. (View included images)

== Installation Details ==

1. Open your themes content.php file and scrool down to where you see the `<footer class="entry-meta">` section
2. Paste this code (as is) `<br />This post has been viewed <?php echo_views(get_the_ID()); ?> times` inline with the "edit-link" section (see the included screenshots for reference)
3. Save your changes
4. Done!

== Installation Notes ==

1. The text can be changed to your liking. Example: 'This post has been viewed' can be changed to 'Total post views =' or what ever it is you like
2. Remember to add the pre-pending `<br />`
3. Please understand that different themes may require different placement of the code.

== Screenshots ==

1. Database table created by plugin
2. Pasting the code snippet into your theme's content.php file
3. The plugin in action (example)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I integrate the plugin into my posts? =

Simply add the following piece of code to your theme's content.php file: `<br />This post has been viewed <?php echo_views(get_the_ID()); ?> times`
(add this code exactly as you see it here and refer to the included images to see where exactly to paste the code). Remember to include the 'Total Views' text as well.

__Notes__

= Uninstalling the plugin =

Should you decide to remove the plugin, please make sure that you manually drop the database table that was created when installing the plugin as well as remove 
the code that you have added to your single.php file.

= Re-installing the plugin = 

Simply follow the installation steps as given above. However, ONLY re-install this plugin once you have dropped the 'old' database table that was created by the plugin when you
first installed it. Failing to remove the 'old' database table will cause the plugin to stop counting views (although it will still be displayed). Correct re-install will also 
start from a 0 count again.

= Better Performance = 

Slowing down? Then use this plugin in addition to a db optimizing plugin as well as a cache plugin (such as W3 Total Cache or Super cache). We are planning to include 'built-in' 
optimization functions in a update. 

= Statistics =

Should you need to "pull" view count statistics, please do so by using your Sql database export fucntion. We are looking at extending this function in an update.

= The Code Snippet to add to your content.php file =

`<br />This post has been viewed <?php echo_views(get_the_ID()); ?> times`
